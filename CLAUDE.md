# TrackLog

GPS activity viewer. Imports activities from local file exports (Strava bulk download, Apple Health, or any GPX source) and automatically via Dropbox sync (HealthFit → Dropbox → TrackLog).

## Deploy Workflow

Commit changes → push to GitHub → Vercel auto-deploys via GitHub integration.
Do **not** use `vercel --prod` directly.

## Architecture

Static HTML + Vercel serverless API functions. No build step. Same pattern as TrailView.

**9-function count (3 slots free):** Vercel Hobby plan allows max 12 serverless functions.

## Supabase

Shared project `nfvxmkknkxysjksyhbek` (same as all CharlesLogic apps). Tables use `tl_` prefix.

**One-time setup:** Run `supabase-setup.sql` in the Supabase SQL editor.

Tables:
- `tl_profiles` — one row per user, `approved` boolean, display_name
- `tl_activities` — one row per activity, `geo_points JSONB` stores 50-pt `[[lat,lon,ele|null]]`
- `tl_invites` — email-based invite list
- `tl_dropbox_tokens` — per-user Dropbox OAuth tokens: `dropbox_account_id`, `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `expires_at`, `folder_path`

**Pre-existing Supabase users** won't have a `tl_profiles` row. Insert manually:
```sql
INSERT INTO tl_profiles (id, display_name, approved)
SELECT id, raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name', false
FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'user@example.com'
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;
```

## Environment Variables

Set in Vercel dashboard for the `tracklog` project:

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `SUPABASE_URL` | `https://nfvxmkknkxysjksyhbek.supabase.co` |
| `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | (from Supabase dashboard → Settings → API) |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | (from Supabase dashboard → Settings → API) |
| `APP_URL` | `https://tracks.charleslogic.com` |
| `TL_ADMIN_USER_ID` | Supabase UUID of the admin user |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | For invite emails |
| `DROPBOX_APP_KEY` | Dropbox app key (from Dropbox App Console) |
| `DROPBOX_APP_SECRET` | Dropbox app secret (from Dropbox App Console) |

## Dropbox Auto-Sync

Replaces the old Strava API integration. Pipeline:
```
Apple Watch (WorkOutDoors) → Apple Health → HealthFit (iOS) → Dropbox /Apps/HealthFitExporter/ → TrackLog
```

HealthFit automatically exports new workouts as GPX files to Dropbox after each workout syncs to Apple Health.

### How it works

- **Per-user tokens**: Each user connects their own Dropbox account via OAuth. Tokens stored in `tl_dropbox_tokens`. Multiple family members each link their own Dropbox.
- **App-level credentials**: `DROPBOX_APP_KEY` and `DROPBOX_APP_SECRET` identify the TrackLog application to Dropbox (not per-user — same for everyone, correct to keep in env vars).
- **Webhook**: Dropbox POSTs to `/api/dropbox` when files change. The handler verifies the HMAC-SHA256 signature, looks up which TrackLog user owns the changed Dropbox account, and syncs their new GPX files.
- **Manual sync**: "Sync from Dropbox" button in the user menu triggers the same logic on demand.
- **Deduplication**: Uses existing `source_id` upsert. HealthFit files named `Route_*.gpx` get `source_id = 'ah_route_...'` from filename alone, so already-imported files are skipped before downloading.
- **Token refresh**: Short-lived Dropbox tokens are refreshed automatically before each API call if within 5 minutes of expiry.
- **Dropbox folder as transit queue**: The `/Apps/HealthFitExporter/` folder is not a permanent archive — it's a delivery queue. GPX files are tiny so it won't grow large, but it can be cleared manually any time without affecting TrackLog data (the DB is the source of truth).
- **Development mode / testers**: The app stays in Development status. Any Dropbox account can authorize (up to 500) — no need to pre-add testers. Family members just click Connect Dropbox and authorize normally.

### Data sources and roles

| Source | Role | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| Strava | Master archive | Bulk export is the recovery path; keep HealthFit → Strava sync active |
| HealthFit → Dropbox | Live sync lane | Richer data than Strava (full HR, photos); auto-imports new activities |
| TrackLog DB | Working copy | Derived from either source; safe to wipe and rebuild |

### Wipe + reimport recovery procedure

If you wipe TrackLog and reimport from a Strava bulk export:

1. **Wipe TrackLog** (user menu → manager mode → Wipe all activities)
2. **Clear the Dropbox folder** manually — delete all files from `/Apps/HealthFitExporter/` in Dropbox
3. **Reimport Strava bulk export** via the Import button
4. Going forward, Dropbox picks up only new activities (no duplicates)

**Why step 2 is required:** Strava and HealthFit generate different `source_id` values for the same activity (`strava_12345` vs `ah_route_...`). After a wipe, the DB has no memory of the HealthFit files, so the next Dropbox sync would reimport everything as duplicates. Clearing the folder prevents this.

### Dropbox App Console setup (one-time)

1. Create app at https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps — Scoped access
2. **Permissions tab**: enable `files.metadata.read` AND `files.content.read`
3. **OAuth 2 → Redirect URIs**: add `https://tracks.charleslogic.com/api/dropbox?action=callback`
4. **Webhooks**: add `https://tracks.charleslogic.com/api/dropbox`
5. **Settings → Testers**: add each family member's Dropbox email (required while app is in Development status — no Dropbox review needed for a private app)

**Development vs Production status:** The app stays in Development mode. Add each user's Dropbox account email as a Tester in the App Console. No production review needed.

### Connect flow (per user)

1. User clicks "Connect Dropbox" in user menu
2. App calls `GET /api/dropbox?action=auth` → server returns OAuth URL with signed `state` containing user ID
3. User authorizes on Dropbox
4. Dropbox redirects to `APP_URL/api/dropbox?action=callback`
5. Server verifies state HMAC, exchanges code for tokens, stores in `tl_dropbox_tokens`, redirects to app
6. App shows toast "Dropbox connected!" and status line updates

## Import Flow (client-side, manual)

1. User clicks "Import activities" in the user menu
2. `showDirectoryPicker()` opens a folder picker (Chrome/Edge only)
3. App walks the folder tree recursively, collecting `.gpx` and `.gz` files
4. If `activities.csv` is found at the root (Strava export), it's parsed for metadata (name, type, activity ID)
5. Each GPX file is parsed with `DOMParser`; `.gz` files are decompressed with `DecompressionStream('gzip')` (built-in browser API, no library needed)
6. Track points are decimated to 50 points client-side
7. Metadata enrichment:
   - **Strava export**: CSV provides name, type (mapped via TYPE_MAP), and numeric activity ID → `source_id = "strava_12345678"`
   - **Apple Health**: GPX filename starts with `Route_` → `source_id = "ah_Route_..."`; type inferred from speed
   - **Generic GPX**: type inferred from speed/elevation, `source_id` from start time + coordinates
8. Activities batch-POSTed to `/api/import` (20 per batch)
9. On completion, types and map reload

**No wipe on import** — every import is a safe upsert. Re-importing updates existing records (fixes names/types) and adds new ones. Duplicate detection uses `source_id` per user.

## GPX Parsing (server-side)

`api/_lib/gpx.js` is a port of the client-side GPX logic from `index.html`, using `fast-xml-parser` instead of `DOMParser`. Used by `api/dropbox.js` for server-side sync. The same `TYPE_MAP`, `inferType`, `decimate`, `haversineM`, and `makeSourceId` functions are used — if you change the client-side logic, mirror the change in `_lib/gpx.js`.

## Type Normalization

All activity type strings are lowercased and stripped of whitespace/hyphens before lookup in `TYPE_MAP` (defined in both `index.html` and `api/_lib/gpx.js`). Unknown types pass through as-is and get a palette color. To normalize a new variant (e.g. "cycling" → "ride"), add it to both TYPE_MAPs and re-import.

## Wipe

"Wipe all activities" button in manager mode (user menu) calls `POST /api/wipe`. Requires confirmation.

## Manager Mode

Toggle in browser console: `localStorage.setItem('tl-manager', '1')` then reload.
Shows: wipe button, max tracks input, delete button on track detail, Disconnect Dropbox button.

## Version Display

Nav shows short git SHA from `VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA` (set by Vercel automatically), emitted as `X-App-Version` response header by `api/types.js` and read from the response in `index.html`. Falls back to cold-start timestamp in local dev. Same pattern as TrailView and Annoyed.

## Service Worker

Cache name `tracklog-v1`. **Do not bump the cache name to deploy new HTML** — the SW uses a **network-first strategy for HTML** (always fetches fresh, falls back to cache when offline). Static assets (Leaflet, supabase.umd.js) are cache-first. API requests (`/api`) are network-only with an offline JSON fallback. Only bump the cache name if the precache list itself changes.

## Auth

Identical to TrailView: OTP + Google OAuth, invite gate, auto-approve on invite. See TrailView CLAUDE.md for full auth documentation. Supabase dashboard settings (session token revocation OFF, Google provider enabled, Resend SMTP) are shared across all apps on the project.
